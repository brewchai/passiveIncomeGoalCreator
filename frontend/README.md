## 📊 How It Works

### Passive Income Principle

The app is built on the core principle that **your corpus remains intact**. You never need to sell your investments. Instead, they generate fixed income for life through:
- Dividend payments from stocks
- Rental income from properties
- Royalties from intellectual property
- Revenue from side businesses

### Goal Tier System

The application automatically:
1. Sorts your expenses by amount (largest first)
2. Creates cumulative tiers (e.g., Tier 1: Rent, Tier 2: Rent + Groceries, etc.)
3. Calculates how much passive income you need for each milestone
4. Shows your progress toward each goal

### Example

If you have expenses:
- Rent: $2,000
- Groceries: $600
- Utilities: $200

Your goals become:
- **Tier 1**: Cover Rent → Need $2,000/month passive income
- **Tier 2**: Cover Rent + Groceries → Need $2,600/month
- **Tier 3**: Cover All Expenses → Need $2,800/month (Financial Independence!)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist**: Clean, uncluttered interface with lots of whitespace
- **Modern**: Flat design with rounded corners and subtle gradients
- **Neutral Colors**: Soft grays, whites, and accent colors for clarity
- **Typography**: Inter font family for excellent readability
- **Responsive**: Adapts beautifully to any screen size

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`. This means:
- ✅ Your data never leaves your device
- ✅ Complete privacy - no server required
- ✅ Works offline
- ⚠️ Clearing browser data will delete your goals
- ⚠️ Data is not synced across devices
