## What is Coast FIRE?

**TL;DR: Coast FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is when you have saved and invested enough money at an early age that, through the power of compound interest, your portfolio will grow to fully fund your traditional retirement without requiring another dime of contributions. You are then free to "coast" by taking lower-stress jobs just to cover your current living expenses.**

Coast FIRE is financial independence with a twist: Instead of aggressively saving until you can fully leave the workforce, you front-load your investments. You save enough early on so your investments grow to cover retirement by themselves. Then, you're free to coast — just earning enough to cover current expenses.

Coast FIRE is ideal if you:

* Want financial freedom but still enjoy working
* Prefer flexibility over quitting work entirely
* Have a solid savings foundation and understand the safe withdrawal rate
* Value lower stress and more life balance

---

## Core Concept: Already Enough vs. Saving More

The magic of Coast FIRE lies in understanding when you’ve saved enough — even if it doesn’t look like it.

Once your investment balance hits a critical point, you can stop contributing and let growth carry you to retirement.

Here's the essence:

> *If you invested $200k by age 35, earning 7% per year, it will grow to over $1M by age 60 — without adding another dollar.*

---

## Coast FIRE Math: The Growth Formula

The formula behind calculating your Coast FIRE number relies heavily on compound interest and understanding your safe withdrawal rate. 

To determine how much you need to have invested today, use this Coast FIRE formula:

> **Coast FIRE Number = Retirement Target / (1 + Expected Annual Return) ^ Years to Retirement**

Where:
* **Retirement Target**: Your desired portfolio value at traditional retirement age (e.g., $1M based on a 4% safe withdrawal rate).
* **Expected Annual Return**: Your estimated inflation-adjusted portfolio growth (commonly 5-7%).
* **Years to Retirement**: The time between now and when you want to fully retire.

**For example:**

If you want $1,000,000 at age 60, and you're currently 30:

[ Current Portfolio Required = 1,000,000 / (1.07)^30 ≈ $131,000 ]

That means if you already have $131k invested at age 30, you’ve hit Coast FIRE.

## Timeline to Coast FIRE: How Long Until You Can Stop Saving?

| $80k          | 30%          | 12 years            | ~35            |
| $100k         | 40%          | 8 years             | ~34            |
| $120k         | 50%          | 6 years             | ~32            |

## Coast FIRE vs. Other FIRE Types

To truly understand what Coast FIRE is, it usually helps to compare it to the other popular Financial Independence, Retire Early methodologies.

### Coast FIRE vs. Lean FIRE
Lean FIRE focuses on accumulating a smaller portfolio (usually under $1M) by drastically minimizing expenses and adopting a highly frugal lifestyle to retire as fast as possible. Coast FIRE, on the other hand, does not require extreme frugality once you hit your Coast number. Instead of retiring early, Coast FIRE adherents continue to work—just at a less demanding pace—while relying on compounding returns for their traditional retirement.

### Coast FIRE vs. Barista FIRE
Barista FIRE and Coast FIRE look very similar from the outside, but the mechanics are different. [Barista FIRE](/blog/what-is-barista-FIRE) involves retiring from your main career before you hit full FI and picking up a part-time job (often for health insurance benefits) to partially cover your expenses and slow down portfolio withdrawals. Coast FIRE specifically focuses on hitting a math milestone early on so you can entirely stop retirement contributions, using income from any job purely to cover current costs.

## Should You Stop Saving Entirely?

Once you hit Coast FIRE, stopping saving doesn’t mean stopping investing. Here's what it means:

* **You invest no more money**, but leave your existing portfolio invested
* Work for income only to cover present expenses (not future retirement)
* Gain flexibility — part-time work, passion projects, sabbaticals

Stopping savings is optional. Many Coast FIRE achievers continue investing small amounts or use employer matches.

---

## High-Impact Strategies to Reach Coast FIRE Faster

1. **Save Early and Aggressively:** The earlier you invest, the bigger the compounding window.
2. **Catch Employer Match:** Free money towards your portfolio.
3. **Increase Income:** Negotiate your salary, upskill, freelance.
4. **Optimize Taxes:** Use tax-advantaged accounts (401k, Roth IRA, HSA).
5. **Control Expenses:** Keep lifestyle inflation in check.

---

## Where to Live (and Work)

Coast FIRE doesn't require geo-arbitrage like Lean FIRE, but you can benefit from:

* **Lower cost cities:** Portland over San Francisco, Austin over NYC
* **Remote work opportunities:** Earn big city pay while living elsewhere
* **Tax-friendly states:** No income tax in Florida, Texas, Washington

---

## Income Options in a Coast FIRE Life

Once you stop saving for retirement, income can be more casual or passion-driven:

* Freelancing, consulting, part-time roles (similar to [Barista FIRE](/blog/what-is-barista-FIRE))
* Entrepreneurship or creative work
* Seasonal or project-based jobs

The key is **income to cover expenses now**, not to build a retirement portfolio.

---

## Key Risks and Safety Nets

Even with Coast FIRE, plan for the unexpected:

* **Market downturns:** Have a buffer — ideally an emergency fund
* **Health insurance:** Don’t rely on employer coverage indefinitely
* **Career flexibility:** Keep skills sharp; avoid stagnation
* **Life changes:** Divorce, disability, or dependents may change your plans

## Advanced Concepts: The Psychology and Flexibility of Coast FIRE

While the math behind Coast FIRE is powerful, the psychology behind it is just as critical. For many, the idea of stepping off the traditional savings treadmill feels unsettling. There’s a feeling of: *What if I lose momentum?* But the key is to recognize that Coast FIRE is **not about giving up on the future**—it’s about trusting the compounding engine you’ve built.

Here are three psychological shifts you’ll need to embrace:

1. **Letting go of the hustle mindset:** Once you hit Coast FIRE, working becomes optional, not mandatory.
2. **Redefining success:** Moving away from chasing promotions and instead pursuing balance or passion.
3. **Trusting your investments:** This requires understanding market cycles and sticking to the plan.

## Flexibility in Coast FIRE: How to Adapt as Life Evolves

Coast FIRE is not static—it flexes with your life. If your income grows, you may coast sooner. If you decide to have kids or move to a more expensive city, you may slow down your coast timeline.

The beauty of Coast FIRE is its adaptability. You can:

* Continue contributing small amounts
* Slow down or accelerate based on circumstances
* Pivot careers without fear of financial ruin

---

## Bonus Section: Coast FIRE vs. Coast Actually Living Abroad

One underrated strategy to make the coast period more enjoyable is geo-arbitrage. Living abroad in lower-cost countries during your coast phase lets you maintain a high quality of life while letting your investments compound untouched.

**Popular Coast FIRE-friendly destinations:**

* **Portugal** – Affordable healthcare, high standard of living.
* **Thailand** – Low cost, vibrant expat community, tropical lifestyle.
* **Mexico** – Close to the U.S., great climate, affordable living.
