            <article class="post-content">

                <p>I need to confess something.</p>

                <p>I run a blog called <em>But First, FIRE</em>. I write about financial independence, early retirement,
                    savings rates, and withdrawal strategies. I've published articles on <a
                        href="/blog/calculating-fire-number">how to calculate your FIRE number</a> and <a
                        href="/blog/can-i-retire-at-35-with-500k">whether $500k is enough to retire at 35</a>.</p>

                <p>And yet — I'm not sure I actually want to retire.</p>

                <p>I don't think most people do, either. Not really. What they want is to <strong>stop doing something
                        they hate</strong>. Those are very different things.</p>

                <hr />

                <h2>What Is Retirement, Really?</h2>

                <p>Here's how we're trained to think about it: you work for 40 years, save diligently, and then one day
                    you stop. You play golf. You garden. You travel. You're <em>free</em>.</p>

                <p>But that's a 20th-century fantasy. It was invented for factory workers who destroyed their bodies by
                    65 and needed rest. It was a reward for physical labor in an era when most people didn't live past
                    72.</p>

                <p>We've inherited this narrative without questioning it. We've just moved the goalpost — from 65 to 45
                    to 35 — and called it a movement.</p>

                <div class="pullquote">Retirement isn't a destination. It's the absence of something. And you can't
                    build a life around an absence.</div>

                <p>Think about it: when someone says "I want to retire at 35," what they usually mean is one of these:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"I hate my job and want to escape."</li>
                    <li>"I want to travel without asking for permission."</li>
                    <li>"I want control over my time."</li>
                    <li>"I don't want to answer to anyone."</li>
                    <li>"I want to do work I actually care about."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>None of those require retirement. Every single one of them requires <strong>freedom</strong>. And
                    freedom and retirement are not the same thing.</p>

                <hr />

                <h2>Hating Your Job ≠ Wanting to Retire</h2>

                <p>Let me get personal.</p>

                <p>At 23, I was buried in $40,000 of debt, at 25 I started commuting 20 minutes each way to an open desk
                    where I wrote code
                    for a product I didn't believe in, managed by someone who scheduled meetings about scheduling
                    meetings. I would sit in standups thinking about how many days until Friday. Then on Friday, I'd
                    think about how many days until the next Friday. My life was a countdown to nothing.</p>

                <p>That's when I discovered FIRE. And it felt like someone had handed me the key to my prison cell.</p>

                <p><em>Just save 70% of your income for 10 years and you'll never have to work again.</em></p>

                <p>I latched onto that like it was scripture. <a href="/blog/40k-debt-to-1m-at-33">I paid off the debt,
                        built to $1M by 33</a>, moved to Vietnam, and <a href="/blog/living-on-1100-per-month">brought
                        my expenses down to $1,100/month</a>. By every FIRE metric, I'd made it.</p>

                <p>But here's what nobody in the FIRE community talks about honestly: the day after you "retire,"
                    <strong>you're still you</strong>. You still wake up at the same time. You still have the same
                    brain. The same anxieties. The same restlessness.
                </p>

                <p>The discomfort I felt on that desk? It wasn't about the job. It was about <em>not having agency
                        over my life</em>. The job was just the most visible symptom.</p>

                <hr />

                <h2>The Case Against Early Retirement</h2>

                <p>I know — heresy, coming from a FIRE blog. But hear me out. There are real, serious problems with
                    retiring at 33.</p>

                <h3>1. You Lose Your Identity</h3>
                <p>In every culture on earth, one of the first questions people ask is: <em>"What do you do?"</em> It's
                    not just small talk. It's how humans locate each other socially, intellectually, tribally.</p>

                <p>When you retire at 33, the answer becomes... nothing? "I manage my portfolio"? "I'm retired"? Try
                    saying that to someone over dinner and watch the conversation die.</p>

                <p>Work gives you structure, purpose, and a community of people who share a mission with you — even if
                    the mission is just shipping a quarterly report. Strip that away and you have to build all three
                    from scratch. Most people vastly overestimate their ability to do this.</p>

                <h3>2. You Solve the Wrong Problem</h3>
                <p>If you hate Monday mornings, the issue might not be that you need to eliminate Mondays. It might be
                    that you need a <em>different</em> Monday.</p>

                <p>Retiring to escape a bad job is like selling your house because of a leaky faucet. The faucet was
                    fixable. You just needed a different job — or a different relationship with work entirely. Not the
                    nuclear option of never working again.</p>

                <h3>3. Boredom Is Real and Underrated</h3>
                <p>The first three months feel like an extended vacation. Months 4 through 8 feel like freedom.
                    Somewhere around month 9, something shifts. You start waking up without a reason. You scroll more.
                    You pick up projects and drop them. You feel vaguely guilty about being unproductive, even though
                    productivity is supposedly something you've opted out of.</p>

                <p>Studies consistently show that people who retire early without a strong sense of purpose have
                    <strong>higher rates of depression, cognitive decline, and social isolation</strong>. The mind needs
                    friction. It needs problems to solve. Not spreadsheet-problems — but real, meaningful,
                    <em>this-matters</em> problems.
                </p>

                <h3>4. 57 Years Is a Long Time to Fund</h3>
                <p>This one's just math. If you retire at 33, you're betting that the next 57 years will be financially
                    smooth. No major health crises. No global upheavals that wreck markets for a decade. No inflation
                    regime that erodes your purchasing power. No black swan that your Monte Carlo simulation didn't
                    account for.</p>

                <p>The <a href="/blog/calculating-fire-number">4% rule was designed for 30 years</a>, not 57. You're
                    running a financial experiment with no control group and no do-over.</p>

                <hr />

                <h2>The Case For Early Retirement</h2>

                <p>Now let me argue the other side — because it's just as real.</p>

                <h3>1. Time Is the Only Non-Renewable Resource</h3>
                <p>Money compounds. Skills compound. Relationships compound. Time does not compound. It only depletes.
                </p>

                <p>Every year you spend doing work you don't care about is a year you'll never get back. You can always
                    make more money. You can never make more time. A 33-year-old has approximately 500,000 waking hours
                    left until age 90. How many of those are you willing to sell to someone else?</p>

                <h3>2. Your Best Years Are Now</h3>
                <p>The traditional retirement model asks you to trade your healthiest, most energetic, most adventurous
                    years for money — and then gives you that freedom back when your knees hurt and your energy is
                    declining. That's insane. It's a terrible deal.</p>

                <p>At 33, you can hike Patagonia. At 70, maybe not. At 33, you can move to a new country on a whim. At
                    70, you're thinking about proximity to hospitals. The value of a free hour at 33 is worth
                    dramatically more than a free hour at 70.</p>

                <h3>3. The Default Path Is Not Designed for You</h3>
                <p>The 40-year career path was designed for corporations, not humans. It optimizes for predictable labor
                    supply, not for human flourishing. The fact that it's "normal" doesn't make it good. Slavery was
                    normal. Child labor was normal. Normal means nothing.</p>

                <p>Early retirement — or more precisely, <em>financial independence</em> — is simply the recognition
                    that you don't have to follow a path designed by someone else's economic incentives.</p>

                <h3>4. You Might Actually Do Your Best Work</h3>
                <p>Here's the irony: many people who "retire" early end up doing the most meaningful work of their
                    lives. They write. They build. They teach. They volunteer. They start companies not because they
                    need the money, but because they're free to take real risks.</p>

                <p>When you remove financial pressure from the equation, you unlock a completely different relationship
                    with work. You do things because they matter, not because they pay. And that difference — work you
                    <em>choose</em> versus work you <em>have</em> to do — changes everything.

                <h2>What If You Don't Retire at All?</h2>

                <p>Here's the third option nobody talks about in FIRE circles: <strong>what if retirement isn't the
                        goal?</strong></p>

                <p>What if, instead of racing to escape work, you redesign your relationship with it?</p>

                <p>Some possibilities:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Work less, not never.</strong> What if you worked 20 hours a week on something you
                        genuinely enjoy? You'd still earn money, maintain structure, and have social connection — but
                        you'd also have 80+ hours a week that are entirely yours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Change the work, not the working.</strong> The problem might not be work itself. It
                        might be <em>your</em> work. A toxic boss, a meaningless product, a soul-crushing commute. Fix
                        those variables and "work" starts to feel very different.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pursue <a href="/blog/what-is-Coast-FIRE">Coast FIRE</a> or <a
                                href="/blog/what-is-barista-FIRE">Barista FIRE</a>.</strong> Save enough that your money
                        will grow to cover traditional retirement on its own, then take a low-stress job that covers
                        your current expenses. You get the security of FIRE without the existential vacuum of full
                        retirement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build something you'd do for free.</strong> If you had $10M in the bank and someone
                        offered you a job — what would that job look like? Go build that. The money is just a
                        constraint, not the purpose.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="pullquote">The goal was never to stop working. The goal was to stop working on things that
                    don't matter to you.</div>

                <hr />

                <h2>What I Actually Did</h2>

                <p>I'll be honest about my own path because I think it's more useful than theory.</p>

                <p>I hit my FIRE number. I "retired." I moved to Vietnam. For the first few months, it was euphoric. I
                    woke up without an alarm. I went to the gym at 10am. I ate pho for breakfast and watched the world
                    go by from a café overlooking the ocean.</p>

                <p>Around month four, something changed. I started feeling restless. Not bored exactly — but
                    <em>untethered</em>. Like I was floating. No deadlines. No team depending on me. No problems that
                    needed solving urgently. It sounds like paradise, and in many ways it was. But humans aren't built
                    for paradise. We're built for problems.
                </p>

                <p>So I started building things again. Not because I needed the money — <a
                        href="/blog/living-on-1100-per-month">my expenses are $1,100/month</a> and my portfolio covers
                    that easily. But because I realized that what I hated was never <em>work</em>. What I hated was
                    <strong>working on someone else's dream, on someone else's schedule, for someone else's
                        reasons</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>I now write this blog. I build tools. I'm learning things I never had time to learn when I was
                    optimizing for a promotion I didn't want. I work maybe 4 hours a day, on whatever I feel like, from
                    wherever I am. Is that retired? Is that working? I genuinely don't know. And I've stopped caring
                    about the label.</p>

                <hr />

                <h2>The Real Question</h2>

                <p>If you're reading this, you're probably somewhere in the FIRE journey. Maybe you're deep in the
                    accumulation phase, grinding through a job you tolerate, watching your savings rate like a hawk.
                    Maybe you're almost there. Maybe you're already past the finish line and wondering <em>why it
                        doesn't feel the way you expected</em>.</p>

                <p>Wherever you are, I want you to sit with this question:</p>

                <div class="pullquote">If money were no object, what would you spend your Tuesday afternoon doing?</div>

                <p>Not your Saturday. Not your vacation. Your <em>Tuesday</em>.</p>

                <p>Because that's what retirement actually is. It's 10,000 Tuesdays. And if you can't answer that
                    question with clarity and enthusiasm, then maybe the problem isn't that you need to retire faster —
                    it's that you need to figure out what you're retiring <em>to</em>.</p>

                <p>The math of FIRE is straightforward. <a href="/blog/calculating-fire-number">Calculate your
                        number</a>, pick a <a href="/blog/four-different-types-of-fire">flavor of FIRE</a>, execute. The
                    philosophy of FIRE — the actual hard part — is deciding what your life is for.</p>

                <p>Don't retire <em>from</em> something. Retire <em>to</em> something.</p>

                <p>Or don't retire at all. Just get free.</p>
