# The Complete Guide to Calculating Your FIRE Number

The **FIRE number** is the foundational goal of the *Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE)* movement. It represents the total amount of money you need to have invested in a diversified portfolio so that your investments generate enough income to cover your desired annual expenses — allowing you to retire and live financially independent without relying on a traditional job. 

Achieving this number signifies true financial freedom, offering the choice to work only if you want to be.

## What is the FIRE Number?

The FIRE number is typically calculated using the **25x Rule**, which is directly linked to the **4% Rule**. To find your number, you first estimate your desired annual expenses in retirement and then multiply that figure by 25.

### Formula:
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses × 25

**Example:**

If you estimate needing **$48,000 per year** to cover your living costs, your target investment portfolio (your FIRE number) would be:

$48,000 × 25 = $1,200,000

## Explaining the 4% Rule and Why It Matters

The **4% Rule** is the core principle that gives the *25× multiplier* its power. It suggests that if you withdraw no more than **4% of your total investment portfolio’s value** in the first year of retirement, and then adjust that dollar amount annually for inflation, your savings have a high probability (historically, over 95%) of lasting for 30 years or more.

### Why It Matters

- **Trinity Study Origin:**  
  The 4% figure comes from the *Trinity Study*, a landmark piece of financial research that analyzed historical returns of investment portfolios (typically 60% stocks, 40% bonds) over various 30-year periods in the US market. The study found this withdrawal rate was consistently successful.

- **Safety and Sustainability:**  
  It provides a necessary margin of safety against market volatility, particularly against *Sequence of Returns Risk* — the risk that poor market performance early in retirement depletes your portfolio before it has a chance to recover.

- **Clarity:**  
  By setting a *safe withdrawal rate (SWR)*, the rule gives you a clear, measurable goal for your investment accumulation phase.

## Personalizing the Number

The standard 4% Rule assumes a 30-year retirement and a moderate-risk portfolio. For those aiming to retire much earlier (e.g., in their 30s) or those facing unique expenses, personalization is crucial.

### 1. Adjustments for Your Risk Tolerance

Your retirement time horizon significantly impacts your required multiplier:

| **Withdrawal Rate (SWR)** | **Multiplier (FIRE Number)** | **Rationale** |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **3.0%** | 33.3× Annual Expenses | *Very Conservative:* Recommended for very long retirements (50+ years) or extremely low risk tolerance. |
| **3.5%** | 28.6× Annual Expenses | *Conservative:* Provides a higher margin of safety than 4%. |
| **4.0%** | 25.0× Annual Expenses | *Standard:* The classic FIRE number (assumes ~30 years). |
| **4.5%+** | 22.2× Annual Expenses | *Aggressive:* Higher risk of running out of money; often used only if the retiree plans to work part-time (*Barista FIRE*) or has flexible spending. |

### 2. Adjustments for Location and Expected Returns

- **Location / Lifestyle:**  
  Your estimated annual expenses should be realistic for your desired retirement location. If you plan to move to a lower cost of living (LCOL) area — a concept known as *Geo-arbitrage* — your annual expenses will drop, dramatically lowering your FIRE number.  
  Ensure you accurately account for major non-negotiable costs, like healthcare premiums before Medicare eligibility.

- **Expected Returns & Other Income:**  
  If you anticipate receiving reliable guaranteed income (like a pension, social security, or passive real estate rental income), you can **subtract that annual income** from your desired annual expenses before applying the multiplier.  
  This effectively lowers the total portfolio amount you need to save.

**Example:**

If you need **$50,000/year** but expect **$10,000** from a rental property, you only need to multiply:

($50,000 - $10,000) × 25 = $1,000,000
