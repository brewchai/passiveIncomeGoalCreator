* Typical Portfolio: $2M–$4M+

## BaristaFIRE: Work Part-Time, Retire Part-Time

**BaristaFIRE** blends passive income with part-time work. The idea: you don’t need to save *everything* before quitting — you earn enough to cover some expenses, while investments grow.

The name comes from the idea of working a low-pressure job (like *Starbucks*, which offers benefits even to part-time employees).

### Who BaristaFIRE Appeals To

* People wanting to escape corporate or high-stress jobs
* Those who don’t mind working *a little* if it buys flexibility
* People who want healthcare benefits without the grind

### Typical Setup

* Partial portfolio: $500k–$800k
* Part-time income: $20k–$30k+ annually
* Withdraw smaller amounts from investments

### Case Study: Raj, 38, BaristaFIRE in California

Raj quit his tech job but now teaches yoga and works part-time at a community cafe. He earns $28k/year and withdraws $15k from his investments.

**Takeaway:** If you value flexibility more than full retirement, BaristaFIRE offers a softer entry.

### Pros

* Provides structure and purpose
* Easier healthcare coverage
* Smaller initial nest egg required

### Cons

* Income instability
* Still tied to work (even if flexible)
* Requires careful planning to ensure investments grow

## CoastFIRE: Let Compound Interest Do the Heavy Lifting

**CoastFIRE** means you've saved *enough* early in life that if your investments simply grow over time (unaided), they'll fully fund retirement when you reach traditional age. You can now stop contributing to retirement, and only work to cover current expenses.

### Why It’s Called "Coasting"

Because once you reach your target, you're essentially coasting on the power of **compound interest**.

### Key Features

* Requires aggressive savings early in life
* After target reached, you stop or slow down contributions
* Focus typically shifts to passion projects or less stressful roles

### Case Study: Emily, CoastFIRE by 30

At 30, Emily had saved $350,000. Assuming 7% annual growth, that should reach ~$1.6M by age 65. Now she works freelance, only covering living expenses.

**Takeaway:** A great option for early savers who don’t want to wait decades for freedom.

### Pros

* No need to save aggressively once target reached
* Flexible career transitions
* Mental relief: your retirement is *handled*

### Cons

* You still need income for current living
* Requires discipline early on
* Market downturns could delay your plan
