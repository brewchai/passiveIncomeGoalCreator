                <img src="/blog/posts/40k-debt-to-1m-at-33/ninad-retirement.jpg" alt="The 3 Things That Took Me from $40k in Debt to $1M at 33 cover" style="width:100%; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
            </div>

            <article class="post-content">
                <p>I grew up lower middle class in a developing country, in a one-bedroom house with my parents. Money was always tight, and luxuries were never part of the conversation. I think we as a family took 2 vacations in the first 23 years of my life, that too within the same state where I grew up.</p>
<p>But that upbringing left me with a lasting skill: the ability to squeeze value out of every dollar.</p>
<p>At 23, I moved to the United States with <strong>–$40,000 in student loans</strong> and nothing close to financial stability. I still remember the first bout of stress that hit me hard when the loan was approved. I was pacing around relentlessly in my living room with doubt taking center stage in my head of whether this is the right decision or not. <em>The collateral on that loan was my family home after all.</em></p>
<p>Ten years later — seven of those actually working — I've crossed <strong>$1 million in net worth at age 33</strong>.</p>
<p>It feels almost surreal to write that sentence. In hindsight, there are 3 things that helped me get here much faster.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="1-leveraging-tech-and-rsus">1. Leveraging Tech and RSUs</h2>
<p>If you want to hit $1M this early, there's no beating around the bush... <strong>you have to earn a lot of money</strong>. No amount of coupon clipping or aggressive saving can get you there in your early 30s without a high income.</p>
<p>For me, that came through working in tech. A solid salary gave me the base, but the real accelerator was RSUs, but not because they appreciated abnormally...</p>
<p><strong>The first six years of my career, the stock was a dud.</strong> It crawled up maybe 3 to 4 percent a year. Nothing glamorous at all and no I didn't appreciate my way up to a million merrily. But here's the key... <em>I never treated RSUs as cash</em>. They didn't touch my checking account, they didn't factor into my lifestyle, and I never sold them just to fund day-to-day expenses.</p>
<p>I could've inflated my life easily — bigger apartments, fancier trips, whatever. But I didn't. I held on, partly to avoid unnecessary taxes, but mostly because I trained myself to see RSUs as untouchable. They stacked quietly in the background while I lived entirely on my salary <strong>and I saved A LOT of it too</strong>.</p>
<p>Only later, once they had built up, did I start selling portions... not to upgrade my lifestyle, but to diversify into index funds and spread my bets. That decision kept me from being hostage to one company's stock price.</p>
<p>The appreciation only really kicked in after I switched jobs and landed at a company with a stronger stock... but by then, the mindset was already ingrained. RSUs were never lifestyle money. They were wealth-building fuel.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="2-consistent-buy-and-hold-investing">2. Consistent Buy and Hold Investing</h2>
<p>If there's one thing that separates people who dabble from people who build wealth, it's this... they stay in the game. I have a natural inclination to be inspired by humble people, be it in sports or finance. My foundations were laid down upon by listening to a ton of interviews of Warren Buffett and following his advice and style, but at the scale that I could afford.</p>
<p>I didn't jump in and out of stocks chasing hype. I didn't try to time the market. I didn't panic-sell when things dipped. I picked my strategy and stuck with it. I work in tech, and as Warren Buffett said, never invest in something you don't understand. I only understood tech and I stayed invested in it. Yes it does sound risky, but I'm young and I went with it. I'm now actively moving more money into ETFs to avoid concentrated risk.</p>
<p>Being dumb surprisingly helped along the way. I was not smart enough to get into complicated investing strategies like options or understanding domains outside my expertise. I was also lazy enough to never get into day trading and all that fluff either.</p>
<p>Over the years, my portfolio returned around 13 percent CAGR. Not because I'm some investing genius... but because I refused to interrupt compounding.</p>
<p>That conviction was tested in 2020. When COVID hit, the market tanked hard. My portfolio went deep into the red, about 25% lost. I could've sold and "protected" myself... but I didn't. (At that time investing was still a bit new for me but I still had a sizable chunk in the market. Probably around 70% of what I had was in the market.) In fact, I doubled down during that period. While people were pulling money out, I was buying more. And this was only possible because I never inflated my lifestyle in proportion with my RSUs.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy to watch 25% losses pile up on paper... but I kept zooming out. I trusted the market to recover like it always had. And sure enough, it did. That single decision — to buy instead of bail — accelerated my path more than anything else.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-saving-50-percent-of-my-income">3. Saving 50 Percent of My Income</h2>
<p>The simplest thing I did was also the most powerful... I saved half of what I earned.</p>
<p>That's it. No fancy hacks. No complicated spreadsheets. Just living on about 50 percent of my income and letting the rest pile up month after month.</p>
<p>And I wasn't depriving myself. This wasn't done consciously by setting meticulous budgets and killing all my hearts desires. I ate out but never at michelin star places, I traveled but never stayed at 4 or 5 star hotels, I bought a nice car but a used one and only after 3 years of saving for it. I cared about value. Every flight, every grocery run, every purchase... I made sure I was getting the best deal.</p>
<p>Housing was the anchor. I always chose modest apartments because rent is the biggest expense. (Except for that one year in New York where I lived in a luxury building right outside of Times Square with insane views... but outside of that, I kept things simple.)</p>
<p><em>High income gave me the engine, savings gave me the fuel, investing gave me the acceleration.</em></p>
<p>Without any of these 3, there's no $1M at 33 coming from a 9-5.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>While I'm fortunate enough to be in this position, I've made a lot of mistakes along the way. But the core formula stayed the same:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Earn more</strong> — leverage your skills in high-paying industries</li>
<li><strong>Stay invested</strong> — don't interrupt compounding</li>
<li><strong>Save aggressively</strong> — but don't deprive yourself</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're starting from debt like I was, know that it's possible. It took me 10 years, but the principles are timeless. Start where you are, use what you have, and stay consistent.</p>
<p>Your future millionaire self is already thanking you.</p>
