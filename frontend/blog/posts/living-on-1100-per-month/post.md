# From $6,000/Month in NYC to $1,100 Abroad: My Geo-Arbitrage Experiment

When I tell people I went from spending **$6,000 a month in New York City** to living comfortably on **$1,100 a month** abroad, they assume I'm either lying or living in a tent. 

Neither is true.

I'm living in a modern apartment, eating well, staying fit with a personal trainer, and maintaining the same quality of life I had in Manhattan — just for **82% less money**.

This is what geo-arbitrage looks like in practice. Not theoretical blog advice. Real numbers. Real life.

## The NYC Reality: $6,000/Month

Let me break down what I was spending in New York:

| Category | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Rent (1BR in Manhattan) | $3,200 |
| Food & dining out | $1,200 |
| Gym membership | $300 |
| Transportation (subway + Ubers) | $150 |
| Utilities & internet | $180 |
| Entertainment & misc | $600 |
| Health insurance | $370 |
| **Total** | **$6,000** |

That's **$72,000 a year** just to exist in New York.

And I wasn't living extravagantly. No penthouse. No Michelin-star dinners every week. Just a normal, comfortable life in one of the most expensive cities in the world.

The problem? Even with a six-figure tech salary, saving 50% of my income meant I was still burning through $72k annually on lifestyle.

## The Shift: Moving Abroad

After hitting my [FIRE number at 33](/blog/40k-debt-to-1m-at-33), I didn't want to keep working just to fund an expensive lifestyle. I wanted freedom.

So I made a decision: **geographic arbitrage**.

I moved to Vietnam — specifically Da Nang, a coastal city with beaches, modern infrastructure, and a thriving expat community — and completely restructured my expenses.

Here's what my life costs now:

| Category | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Apartment + utilities | $350 |
| Food budget ($20/day) | $600 |
| Gym membership | $20 |
| Scooter rental + gas | $75 |
| Personal trainer (3x/week) | $190 |
| **Total** | **$1,235** |

Let's round it to **$1,100–$1,200/month** depending on the month.

That's **$14,400/year** instead of $72,000.

## Breaking Down the Numbers

### Apartment + Utilities: $350
I live in a modern 1-bedroom apartment **steps from the beach** with:
- Air conditioning
- Fast WiFi (100+ Mbps)
- Balcony with ocean breeze
- 24/7 security
- Walking distance to everything

In NYC, this would cost $3,000+ easily. Here in Da Nang? $350 all-in.

### Food: $20/Day ($600/Month)
I eat out almost every meal. Thai food, Western food, healthy bowls, smoothies — whatever I want.

$20/day gets you:
- Breakfast: $3–$5
- Lunch: $5–$7
- Dinner: $7–$10
- Coffee/snacks: $3–$5

In New York, one meal out was $20–$30 minimum. Here, I'm eating better for less.

### Gym: $20/Month
A solid gym with free weights, machines, and cardio equipment. No frills, but everything I need.

(If I wanted the luxury gym with pool, sauna, and classes, it's $42/month — still a fraction of the $300/month I was paying in NYC.)

### Scooter Rental + Gas: $75/Month
I rent a scooter for $50/month and spend ~$25 on gas.

This replaces the $300/month I spent on subway passes and Ubers in NYC.

### Personal Trainer: $190/Month
I train 3x/week with a certified trainer. Sessions are $15 each.

In New York, personal training was $100+ per session. I couldn't afford it.

Now? I'm in the best shape of my life for a fraction of the cost.

## What I Gave Up (Spoiler: Not Much)

People assume moving abroad means sacrificing comfort. Here's what I actually gave up:

- ❌ Expensive rent
- ❌ $25 cocktails
- ❌ $8 coffees
- ❌ Overpriced everything

Here's what I **didn't** give up:

- ✅ Modern apartment (with beach access!)
- ✅ Great food
- ✅ Fitness routine (actually better now)
- ✅ Fast internet
- ✅ Social life
- ✅ Safety and comfort
- ✅ Living by the ocean

If anything, my quality of life **improved**. I have more time, less stress, I'm healthier, and I wake up to ocean views every day.

## The FIRE Math: How This Changes Everything

Living on $1,200/month instead of $6,000/month completely changes your [FIRE number](/blog/calculating-fire-number).

**In NYC:**
- Annual expenses: $72,000
- FIRE number (25x rule): **$1.8 million**

**Abroad:**
- Annual expenses: $14,400
- FIRE number (25x rule): **$360,000**

That's a **$1.44 million difference**.

By moving abroad, I effectively "bought" my freedom **years earlier** than if I had stayed in New York.

## Is This Sustainable Long-Term?

The most common question I get: *"Yeah, but can you live like this forever?"*

Honestly? I don't know. And I don't need to.

Here's the beauty of geo-arbitrage: **it's flexible**.

- If I want to move back to the U.S., I can.
- If I want to try another country, I can.
- If I want to increase my budget, I can.

The point isn't to live on $1,100/month forever. The point is that I **can** if I want to. And that optionality is freedom.

Right now, I'm letting my investments compound while spending a fraction of what I used to. In a few years, I'll have even more options.

## The Real Cost of NYC (That Nobody Talks About)

Living in New York wasn't just expensive financially. It was expensive in other ways:

- **Time**: 1+ hour commutes, waiting for trains, sitting in traffic
- **Stress**: Noise, crowds, constant hustle
- **Health**: Less sleep, more takeout, gym too expensive to justify a trainer

Moving abroad gave me back:

- **Time**: I work from home, scooter everywhere in 10 minutes
- **Calm**: Quiet mornings, less chaos
- **Health**: Personal trainer 3x/week, better food, more sleep

These aren't things you can put a price on, but they matter more than the $6,000/month I was spending.

## Final Thoughts

I'm not saying everyone should move to Vietnam. Geo-arbitrage looks different for everyone.

Maybe it's:
- Moving from San Francisco to Austin
- Moving from NYC to Portugal or Da Nang
- Moving from LA to Mexico
- Moving from London to Bali

The principle is the same: **reduce your cost of living without reducing your quality of life**.

For me, going from $6,000/month to $1,100/month was the unlock. It gave me freedom, health, and time.

And honestly? I'm happier now than I ever was in New York.

If you're on the FIRE path and feeling stuck because your expenses are too high, consider this: **location is the biggest lever you can pull**.

You don't need to earn more. You just need to spend smarter.

Start by [saving $500/month](/blog/How-to-save-500-per-month), then explore [Coast FIRE](/blog/what-is-Coast-FIRE) as a stepping stone to full financial independence.

Your future self will thank you.
